    "If you double click on this cell (go ahead, try it), you'll note that the text *changes* slightly. That's becasue this is written in markdown, which means that **some** of the text is changed before you see it. To do *italics* wrap things in stars. To write `code` type in the backtick character (to the left of 1). This distinction about markdown will be useful to us as we consider how webpages are rendered. We can even put in [helpful links](https://www.markdownguide.org/). In a jupyter notebook, if you want to render the code, simply run this cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's talk about [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/). Flask allows you to create an API--an application programming interface. What this means in practical terms, is to make your code accessible outside of the coding environment. We see this all the time, but we hardly think about it. Websites are the perfect example, and in fact Flask is meant to be viewed through your web browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "I want to be clear on one point here. I'm not teaching Flask so that you can master it (as much as that would be awesome). Rather, I'm introducing Flask, so that you can be familiar with it. To be sure we're going to play around with it, but we're just going to scratch the surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing you will have to do is [install Flask](https://pypi.org/project/Flask/). You should be able to accomplish this by saying `pip install Flask`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### HTML\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way Flask is an interface between the web and our python code. We've got the python code part figured out, but what about the web part? The answer is HTML, which is ***not*** a programming language. There are no loops, no if statements, none of that, rather it's like a more sophisticated markdown language. Again I'm not going to teach HTML for mastery, but rather introduce it for familiarity. \n",
